# P4 Resource Exchange
### Posting Resource Requests and Offers -  Standard Operating Procedures

The P4 Resource Exchange provides a capability for organizations in need of resources (food, water, etc.) to connect with organizations that have those resources available. The following guide provides standard operating procedures for posting requests and offers, committing offers, and using the admin dashboard feature.

# Navigation

Before using the Resource Exchange app, an admin will need to provide you with access. The Resource Exchange app may be loaded in a tab within Microsoft Teams, or with a direct web link. While the Resource Exchange site can be accessed without signing in, you must sign-in before viewing or posting any resource requests or offers.

Note: the app may not correctly prompt you to sign-in if you are using Teams within a web-browser. If you encounter an error when accessing the app within a Teams tab, open the app in a new browser tab. 

The main menu on the Resource Exchange app contains a **Home** link to navigate back to the main Resource Exchange home page (pictured below), as well as links to **Requests** and **Offers**  . The **Requests** and **Offers** menu options contain sub-links to create batch requests/offers or to update existing requests/offers.

Figure 1. Resource Exchange Home Page 

The **Requests** and **Offers** pages contain a searchable, sortable list of existing, active requests and offers (e.g., status = Active or In Progress). To search the list, enter a keyword in the search box and hit enter or click the magnifying glass icon. Click on the field names on the top row of the list to toggle the sort order (ascending/descending) for that field.

The lists on the **Requests** and **Offers** pages contain a row-level menu that can be accessed by clicking on the  down arrow  icon. The options displayed depend on the page you are currently on.

# Posting Batch Requests or Offers

To post a list of multiple resource requests, select the **Batch Upload** option on the **Requests** menu.

 Figure 5. Menu options to create batch uploads for Requests or Offers. 

The **Batch Upload** page will be displayed. The page contains a link to download the batch upload template (comma-separated value format). Save this file to your local computer and then populate the template with your requests or offers. Ensure that you do not include any commas in the text fields, as this will cause errors in the import process.

After you complete adding your requests or offers to the batch upload file, back on the Batch Upload page, provide a name to describe your request or offer and select **Yes** for the Batch Upload option.

Click **Next**  .

You will be prompted to upload the batch file as an attachment.

Click **Submit**  . You should receive a confirmation that your file has been uploaded successfully.

The batch upload process should take less than a minute to complete. You should be able to confirm that your requests or offers were successfully imported by navigating to the **Requests** or **Offers** pages.

# Committing Offers to Existing Requests

Users can review existing, active requests on the **Requests** page and select the row-action option to **Commit Resource** for any resources that they can complete.

 Figure 7. Committing to an existing Resource Request. 

A form will be displayed, with options to  commit resources  to the request, provide  details  and an  attachment  (optional). Provide as much details as possible to share with the user that posted the request. They will receive a notification via Teams about the offer to support the resource request.

 To update the status of a request or offer, select the  **Update [Requests or Offers]**  option on the **Requests** or **Offers** menu.

Use this view to update the status of requests or offers that you have posted to the Resource Exchange. You will only see items that you have posted.

Select the dropdown arrow next to the item that you want to edit and select  **Edit (request or offer) Status.**

 Figure 10. Edit Request status option on the Update Requests page. 

The owner of the **Request** or **Offer** can then update the record, for example changing the status from 'Active' to 'In Progress' or 'Closed'. If the status is updated to Closed or Cancelled, it will be removed from the **Active Requests** / **Offers** list.

# Admin Dashboard

Click the link for the **Admin Dashboard** on the Resource Exchange homepage. The team administrator may also embed this as a tab within teams.

 Figure 12. Admin (Power Bi) Dashboard. 

The dashboard contains interactive widgets to filter existing Requests and Offers by Status or using a text-based search option. You can select a Request or Offer from the embedded lists to display the corresponding Offers or Requests, using a 'fuzzy matching' comparison between the two tables.

Hovering your mouse over a widget will expose options on the top right, including option to copy existing snapshot of the widget, explore the filters applied to the widget, expand the widget to full screen, and perform various data operations (export data, show as table, spotlight, get insights, and sort data).
